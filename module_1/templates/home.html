        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> [Jie Xu]</p>
        <p><strong>Position:</strong> [Applied Scientist]</p>
        <p><strong>Bio:</strong> [I am a mechanical engineer and senior project manager with a strong background in advanced manufacturing, mechanical design, and cross-functional project leadership. I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Drexel University, where I developed solid expertise in both fundamental engineering principles and applied research.

Currently, I worked as a Senior Project Manager at RPI Industries, Inc., where I lead complex engineering projects from early concept through execution and delivery. My role involves coordinating multidisciplinary teams, aligning technical solutions with business objectives, and ensuring projects are completed efficiently, on time, and to a high standard of quality.

Throughout my career, I have gained hands-on experience across the full engineering lifecycle, including system design, prototyping, optimization, and process improvement. My academic training and industry experience allow me to effectively bridge the gap between research-driven innovation and real-world industrial applications.

I am passionate about engineering excellence, continuous learning, and applying advanced technologies to solve practical problems. I also value collaboration and enjoy sharing knowledge through mentorship and professional engagement. I am currently having an internship at Echoplus Ai, working as a applied scientist.]</p>
